The TPA library comes in two flavors: Android and CrossPlatform.
Android is the official library used for native apps, CrossPlatform is an internal library used to build libraries for Unity, ReactNative, etc.

The Android library is made accessible through bintray.
Upload/publish of new version of libraries requires permission to the bintray organization.

To Upload:
1. Visit bintray.com and sign in
2. Select the "TPA-Android" repository
3. Select the "TPA-SDK-Android" package
4. Select "Add a Version" on the right hand side
5. Input the correct version in the input box for "Name" (e.g. "5.0.1") and select "Create"
6. Choose the "Files" tab
7. Select the "Upload files" part of the text describing there are no files uploaded for this version (The "Upload files" part is clickable)
8. Select the 3 files from the zip file (not the zip file itself) and click "Upload"
9. Done

The CrossPlatform library should NOT be made accessible through bintray as it contains methods that should not be called from a native app.
Instead it should be included in CrossPlatform libraries that require it.

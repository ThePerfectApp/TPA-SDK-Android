The TPA library comes in two flavors: Android and CrossPlatform.
Android is the official library used for native apps, CrossPlatform is an internal library used to build libraries for Unity, ReactNative, etc.

The Android library is made accessible through bintray.
Upload/publish of new version of libraries requires permission to the bintray organization.

To Upload:
1. Visit bintray.com and sign in.
2. ?
3. Done!

The CrossPlatform library should NOT be made accessible through bintray as it contains methods that should not be called from a native app.
Instead it should be included in CrossPlatform libraries that require it.
